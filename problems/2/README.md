## Problem 2

### Quote

```
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
```

### Approach

#### Brute Force

We start by calculating all the fibonacci numbers until it exceeds 4 million, and adding all even fibonacci numbers to a running total.

We then return the total.

This is the method `brute_force`


#### Elegant Solution

We know a closed form for each fibonacci number that does not require additions over and over (binet's formula), and we know that only f_(3n) numbers are even, so we only do a third of that work.

The reason I call it elegant, is that it uses binet's formula and floating point math to achieve the nth fibonacci numbers without the normal process of adding them together.

This is the method `elegant_solution`

They are both very fast, and which one is more efficient can change based
